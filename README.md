# StaticVis
The branch "static" contains the static visualization implementation which will not be updated as I work on my interactive visualization. The branch "interactive" contains the interactive visualization. The main branch is updated with the interactive vis but also contains the history of the static vis development in its commits. The link (https://marajet.github.io/PoetryProject/) is loaded from the main branch.

I am using one late day for the static vis. I am not using any late days for the interactive vis.
