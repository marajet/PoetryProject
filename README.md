# StaticVis
The branch "static" contains the static visualization implementation which will not be updated as I work on my interactive visualization.
Follow this link to view the static visualization: https://marajet.github.io/PoetryProject/

I am using one late day for the static vis, so the last state of the repository on the day after the due date is the one I'd like graded.
